----------
To create a Python program for a system integrator working with GoHighLevel (GHL) for automated appointment setting and follow-up, we need to cover various aspects of the system, such as workflow automation, AI-powered integrations, CRM optimization, and performance monitoring. This code will serve as a blueprint for implementing and optimizing such a system, with a focus on automating lead engagement and follow-ups through emails, SMS, and other communication channels.

Since GoHighLevel is a web-based platform, integrating it with Python requires using API integrations. Additionally, we will assume AI optimization uses GPT-based chatbots or other conversational AI tools.
Key Python Components to Build:

    GoHighLevel API Integration: For automating workflows and connecting with CRM data.
    AI-Powered Scheduling: Use a chatbot (e.g., GPT-3 or GPT-4) for appointment scheduling.
    Automated Follow-Up: Automated workflows using emails, SMS, or other messaging tools.
    Performance Monitoring: Track the effectiveness of follow-up sequences and client engagement.
    Dynamic Workflow Creation: Automatically adjust workflows based on client interactions and conversions.

Prerequisites:

    GoHighLevel API Access: You must have access to the GoHighLevel API (you can request API access from GoHighLevel support if you donâ€™t have it yet).
    AI Chatbot: You will use GPT-3 or GPT-4 from OpenAI for client interaction and scheduling.
    SMS/Email Service: Integration with services like Twilio (for SMS) and SendGrid or Gmail for emails.

Install Necessary Python Libraries:

pip install requests openai twilio sendgrid

Python Code Example:

import requests
import openai
from twilio.rest import Client
from sendgrid import SendGridAPIClient
from sendgrid.helpers.mail import Mail

# Define API keys (replace with actual keys)
GHL_API_KEY = "your_go_high_level_api_key"
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_openai_api_key"
TWILIO_SID = "your_twilio_sid"
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = "your_twilio_auth_token"
SENDGRID_API_KEY = "your_sendgrid_api_key"

# Initialize OpenAI API
openai.api_key = OPENAI_API_KEY

# Initialize Twilio and SendGrid clients
twilio_client = Client(TWILIO_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN)
sendgrid_client = SendGridAPIClient(SENDGRID_API_KEY)

# GoHighLevel API URL
GHL_BASE_URL = "https://api.gohighlevel.com/v1/"

# Function to fetch leads from GoHighLevel
def fetch_leads():
    url = f"{GHL_BASE_URL}leads/"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {GHL_API_KEY}"}
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()

# Function to create AI-powered appointment scheduling
def schedule_appointment(client_name):
    prompt = f"Hello, {client_name}. I am your virtual assistant. When would you like to schedule your appointment?"
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # You can use GPT-3 or GPT-4 models
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150
    )
    appointment_details = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    print(f"AI Scheduled Appointment for {client_name}: {appointment_details}")
    return appointment_details

# Function to create dynamic follow-up workflows
def follow_up_workflow(lead_data):
    # Simple example of creating a follow-up sequence based on the lead's data
    for lead in lead_data:
        client_name = lead['name']
        client_phone = lead['phone']
        client_email = lead['email']

        # Send an initial follow-up email
        send_email(client_email, "Appointment Follow-Up", f"Hi {client_name}, we're following up on your interest in scheduling an appointment.")
        
        # Send an SMS as a reminder
        send_sms(client_phone, f"Hi {client_name}, just a quick reminder to schedule your appointment!")

        # Use AI to suggest an appointment time
        appointment_details = schedule_appointment(client_name)
        
        # Further actions (e.g., update CRM or schedule the appointment)
        # This can be enhanced by integrating further steps in the workflow
        print(f"Follow-up for {client_name} complete. Appointment details: {appointment_details}")

# Function to create and update GoHighLevel workflows based on client interactions
def update_ghl_workflow(client_id, status):
    url = f"{GHL_BASE_URL}workflows/{client_id}/"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {GHL_API_KEY}"}
    data = {
        "status": status  # Can be 'follow-up', 'scheduled', etc.
    }
    response = requests.put(url, headers=headers, json=data)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print(f"Workflow updated for client {client_id}")
    else:
        print(f"Error updating workflow for client {client_id}: {response.status_code}")

# Main function to manage leads, automation, and follow-up
def main():
    # Step 1: Fetch leads from GoHighLevel CRM
    leads = fetch_leads()
    if leads:
        # Step 2: Run the follow-up workflow for each lead
        follow_up_workflow(leads)

        # Step 3: Update workflows and status in GoHighLevel
        for lead in leads:
            update_ghl_workflow(lead['id'], 'follow-up')  # Example status update

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Explanation:

    GoHighLevel Integration:
        The fetch_leads() function fetches the leads from the GoHighLevel CRM using their API.
        The update_ghl_workflow() function allows updating workflows in GoHighLevel based on client actions or lead status.

    AI-Powered Appointment Scheduling:
        The schedule_appointment() function uses OpenAI's GPT model to interact with the lead and suggest scheduling times for appointments based on AI-driven interactions.

    Follow-Up Automation:
        Automated email and SMS follow-ups are handled using SendGrid and Twilio APIs. Follow-up messages are sent to the leads to ensure they are reminded about their appointments.

    Performance Monitoring:
        While this example does not explicitly handle advanced monitoring, the program outputs logs such as "Follow-up complete" or "Error sending SMS". You can enhance the logging and performance monitoring by storing the outcomes in a database and generating reports.

Customization:

    Advanced Workflows: Modify follow_up_workflow() to create more sophisticated workflows, like adding delays, follow-up sequences, or conditionally scheduling follow-ups.
    Integrate More AI Features: You can add more complex AI models for dynamic lead qualification or real-time chatbot engagement.
    Expand CRM Integration: Further integrate GoHighLevel API to perform more complex operations like automatic task creation or lead scoring.

Next Steps:

    Testing: Test this script with real data and real API keys for GoHighLevel, Twilio, SendGrid, and OpenAI.
    Scaling: For a large number of leads, consider batching requests, and managing rate limits for API calls.
    Error Handling: Enhance error handling for network issues, API limits, etc.

This code provides a framework to build a fully automated AI-powered appointment setting system integrated with GoHighLevel, along with follow-ups and performance monitoring.
